# Text Processing Application

### Project Description:

- Develop a Python application that processes text from a text file and sends it to the OpenAI API for improvements.
- The edited text will be displayed directly underneath the original text for easy comparison.
- Users will have the option to specify the type of improvements they want from the OpenAI API.
- The application will provide a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- Implement a feature that allows users to save the improved text to a new text file.
- Incorporate error handling to notify users if there are any issues with the text processing or API communication.
- Include a feature that enables users to preview the improved text before saving it.
- Enhance the application by adding a spell-checking functionality to ensure the accuracy of the text.
- Implement a feature that allows users to select specific portions of the text for improvement rather than the entire text file.
- Include an option for users to adjust the level of improvement suggested by the OpenAI API.
- Incorporate a progress bar to show the status of the text processing and improvement process.
- Allow users to customize the formatting of the improved text to maintain consistency with the original text.
- Provide clear instructions and tooltips within the application to guide users on how to use the features effectively.

### Tech Stack:

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **API:** OpenAI API
- **Packages:**
